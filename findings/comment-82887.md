Route on what the turn needs to know, not on how hard it looks. The small model's failure in your example wasn't difficulty. "Test the router" is a question whose answer lives in state the model can't see (your router, your tools), and a small model fills unobservable state with plausible invention more readily than a large one. Three signals that hold up without a human, cheapest first:

1. **Self-reference on the input.** The turn names the system, its tools, its config, or the agent's own behaviour → large tier. Match against your own tool manifest and component names rather than a trained classifier: it's a string check, and it catches "test the router".
2. **Irreversibility, classified by the tool, not the text.** Any turn that ends in a write you can't take back (send, delete, pay, merge, publish) goes to the large tier, or gets a large-tier review of the small tier's plan before the call. The tool the turn is about to call is known; the phrasing of the request isn't a reliable proxy for it.
3. **A verifier on the small model's output.** If the small answer names a tool, flag, file or endpoint that isn't in your manifest or repo, discard it and rerun on the large tier. This is the check that would have caught your case mechanically, and it's the one that holds up unattended: it tests the failure itself instead of predicting it, and your manifest is the ground truth, so it needs no training and keeps up as the system grows.

An input classifier will keep missing new phrasings of "a question about the system". An output check against the manifest doesn't care how the question was phrased.

Before trusting any of it: sample some small-tier turns each day, rerun them on the large tier, and diff the answers. The disagreement rate by category is your router's real error table, and it tells you which of the three rules is earning its cost.
